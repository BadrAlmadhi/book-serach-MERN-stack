# Badr Almadhi Portfolio

## Introduction

In this project, I'm refactoring the RESTful API into a GraphQL API for Google Book Search. Users can search for their favorite books and conveniently save selections for future reading. Throughout this project, I've learned how to use GraphQL, Apollo Server, Apollo Client, and JWT to secure user information. It's been a great opportunity to share my progress and showcase what I've learned.

## Installation

I am in the progress of finishing this project there are a few steps left to make this website running. If you still want to see my project in your local computer you can simply follow the steps below:

1. Open GitHub repo for my project or click [here](https://github.com/BadrAlmadhi/book-serach-MERN-stack) to direct you to my repo
2. Then click in code and copy the HTTPS.
3. open code editor and then open terminal to clone repo
4. After terminal is open in your terminal `git clone https....`

## Usage

To utilize this website, you can begin by simply searching for your favorite book in the search bar. However, to save a book, you will need to sign up to unlock this feature. This project provides a description of the book you've searched for and assists in locating it, along with the author's name.
